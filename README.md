# ANN vs Optimal Estimator

## Description

The problem is the standard UFL where a set of n (potential) facilities and m clients are given. For each pair (facility i, client j) an allocation/connection cost c_ij are known together with a setup/opening cost for each facility which is opened. 

## Objective

The decision is twofold: 
* (i) location: which facilities are to be opened;
* (ii) allocation: for each client, the opened facility to be connected to.

An optimal location-allocation decision is such that the overall cost, associated to opened facilities and connections, is minimum.
